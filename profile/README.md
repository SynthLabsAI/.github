### Recent Work
#### _Suppressing Pink Elephants with Direct Principle Feedback_

![Pink_Elephants](https://www.synthlabs.ai/img/cacophony.png)

Our most recent work represents a significant advancement in the field of controllable language models. This [paper addresses](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07896.pdf) the 'Pink Elephant Problem,' a challenge in instructing language models to avoid discussing certain topics (referred to as "Pink Elephants") and instead focus on preferred topics ("Grey Elephants").

- **Controllable Generation**: Our research provides a novel approach to controllable generation, allowing language models to be dynamically adjusted at inference time to meet diverse needs across multiple contexts.
- **Direct Principle Feedback (DPF)**: We introduce a simplification of Constitutional AI, Direct Principle Feedback, which directly applies principles to critiques and revisions without the need for ranking responses.
- **Significant Performance Improvements**: After fine-tuning with DPF on our synthetic Pink Elephants dataset, our 13B fine-tuned LLaMA 2 model outperformed existing models and matched the performance of GPT-4 on our curated test set for the Pink Elephant Problem.

Contributions from Louis Castricato, Nathan Lile, Suraj Anand, Hailey Schoelkopf, Siddharth Verma, and Stella Biderman.
