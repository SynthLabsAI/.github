### [Suppressing Pink Elephants with Direct Principle Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07896)

![Pink_Elephants](https://www.synthlabs.ai/img/cacophony.png)

Our most recent work represents a significant advancement in the field of controllable language models. This [research addresses](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07896.pdf) the 'Pink Elephant Problem' - instructing language models to avoid certain topics ("Pink Elephants") and focus on preferred ones ("Grey Elephants"). Key highlights:

- **Controllable Generation**: Dynamically adjust language models at inference time for diverse needs across multiple contexts

- **Direct Principle Feedback (DPF)**: We introduce a novel simplification of Constitutional AI, Direct Principle Feedback, which directly applies principles to critiques and revisions without the need for ranking responses.

- **Significant Performance Improvements**: After fine-tuning with DPF on our synthetic Pink Elephants dataset, our 13B fine-tuned LLaMA 2 model outperformed existing models and matched the performance of GPT-4 on our curated test set for the Pink Elephant Problem.
